# 🌲 Dark Forest RPG

**Dark Forest RPG** is a turn-based, stat-driven dark fantasy game built with a focus on immersive design, vertical slice architecture, and magical atmosphere.

## 🧙‍♂️ Game Overview

- 🎲 **Turn-Based Combat**: Players cast spells, manage inventory, and battle foes using a stat-focused system.
- 🧩 **No Graphics Engine**: The game focuses on numerical gameplay and interactivity rather than graphical exploration.
- 🧪 **Spells & Effects**: Clickable, stat-triggered spell system, with layered effects and conditions.
